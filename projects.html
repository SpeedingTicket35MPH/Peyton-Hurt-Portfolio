        <p> These are the some of the projects I have worked on at CART or on my own with my band Animosity, or just
            passion projects of mine. Some of these projects I worked on at CART during my Junior year, which those
            would be the video projects. The websites were all created during my senior year while I was in the Web App
            Design Lab and learned how to create websites and use HTML and CSS and little bits of JavaScript to code. I
            have also included some music I have worked on. This is music I worked on with my band Animosity, or music I
            wrote myself. </p>
