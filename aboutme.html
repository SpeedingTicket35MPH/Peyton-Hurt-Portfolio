    <p>
        I am a senior in High School who is ready to graduate on  May 24th 2024. I am planning to attend cloivs community college.
        I was enrolled in the Center For Advanced and Technology for my Juniors and Senior year. In my Junior year I was enrolled in 
        Digital Video Prodcution Lab and created documentaries and Shrot films. During my Senior year i was enrolled in the Web Applications Development
        Class where I learned how to create and design websites. I am also heavily involved with music. I have been playing guitar for 5 and a half years and consider 
        it to be one of my greatest passions in life. I was born on May 9th 2006 and as of time of writing this I am 17 years old.
